\title{Plot the probabilities of an algorithm being better than another.}
\usage{
plot_pwin(
  modout,
  selected = NULL,
  control = NULL,
  rope = c(0.45, 0.55),
  hdi = 0.89
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modout}{A BBT model}

\item{selected}{List of algorithms names to be printed. NULL for all}

\item{control}{An algorithm name, to be seen as the control. Only the
probabilities of the other algorithms against the control will be
plotted}

\item{rope}{The low and the high values of ROPE}

\item{hdi}{The HDI probability to indicate in the plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 plot
}
\description{
Plot the probabilities of an algorithm being better than another.
